    Being an adult male lollybuster wasn't easy. To start with, nobody knew you existed, and 
    therefore nobody could give you any advice on how to behave.

    Rolfin had tried differrent approaches. On Monday he tried being large, arrogant and 
    green. On Tuesday tiny, round and rubberish. On Wednesday he tried being loud, spicy and 
    multifaceted. On Thursday he got fed up and was nothing at all, except himself, but he had 
    doubts that wasn't very acceptable for an adult male lollybuster.

    How he knew it, he didn't know. It was just an instant feeling, a feeling that the world 
    expected more from a male lollybuster. Something big, and loud, and perhaps a bit 
    frightening.

    Rolfin could change himself into anything he wanted, supposing he didn't want to be 
    anything above one eighth of an inch. He could be any shape, colour, texture, have any 
    amount of heads, hands, legs and tails, or be without them if he wanted, make loud or silent or
    tapping sounds, leap, hop, crawl or slide. There were only two things he couldn't change, and 
    even these he could disguise to fit the colour or texture of his present state. The things that 
    remained unaltered were the two eyes he grew up with (nobody exactly knows whether 
    lollybusters are born or hatched or if they just drop from some mysterious parallel universe, 
    perhaps living in the attic) and a figure standing in between them. 

    And Rolfin had truly used this ability. He had changed into everything he suspected to 
    be frightening, but how can you frighten anyone if nobody notices you?

    You can't blame Rolfin for not trying. On Tuesday he had stepped into the middle of the
    floor, banged his chest and yelled ”Mrrraughaaaaaaooodelioo!” He knew the end of it didn't 
    go very well if frightening was meant to happen, but at the moment oodeliooing had felt like 
    the right thing to do.

    But nobody had as much as startled. Actually, Rolfin had to dive behind the cupboard in
    order to not be stepped over. Or not to be vacuumed, which wouldn't have been any better 
    either.

    Rolfin had sat on a torn paperclip and sighed. How on earth did the others make it? Or, 
    a sudden uncertain thought came passing by, did they? What if the others hadn't made it at all 
    and he was the only surviving adult male lollybuster in the whole wide world! Then it was all 
    up to him, keeping up the heroic tradition, the mighty reputation, the true male lollybusteric 
    way of life – if he only knew what it was.

    That had been on Tuesday, and now it was Friday. Wednesday and Thursday had gone by without giving him any hint of how to behave. Nor was there any feeling of things getting 
    easier, or him getting used to this.

    Rolfin changed his position and checked his nails. If he wasn't careful, the nails kept 
    falling off. Perhaps they were a bad idea? But long sharp nails were something he hadn't tried 
    before. So were a lot of other things as well, but it's only so far a lollybuster can think one 
    day. For the next day he was considering bright, shiny yellow eyes with a fluffy tail. He 
    wasn't sure about the tail, though. It might get stuck, if he got into a crowded place. Or into a 
    shallow hole. Or behind the curtain. Or – oh dear, he sighed again, there were so many places 
    he could get stuck in to! 

    He pulled himself together. It was time to make some heavy decisions. If there was no 
    one around to tell him about the proper way of being an adult male lollybuster, then he had no
    option. The only sensible thing to do was to go and find another lollybuster. It was a big 
    world out there, and surely he would find one if he really tried. Yes! That was it, he thought 
    and stood up, feeling very uplifted. It sounded very much like a thing a proper male 
    lollybuster would do in a situation like this.

    He turned around a bit and wondered which would be the best direction to start with. 
    After all, the world was a big place, he had to be careful not to get excausted. He'd better 
    make a good plan, and plenty of sandwiches.

    The very next morning Rolfin began his journey. He had packed 21 sandwiches, an alarm 
    clock for self-defense in case he found something alarming, two pairs of socks and an 
    umbrella. He didn't like getting wet.

    He took a deep breath and took off. He had thought about this for long last night, and 
    had come to the conclusion that the best direction would be west. In the east there was a high 
    wall, in the north there was a deep descending canyon and in the south the climate was 
    probably too hot for him. At least now, when he had decided to wear thick brown fur and 
    three pairs of ears on each of his eleven feet. He wanted to look good, in case he would pop 
    into another lollybuster right away. Though he had to change his appearances pretty soon, 
    since he could not figure out when to use the eleventh foot, so he dropped it behind a dustbin 
    and continued with only ten.

    After long and tiresome ten minutes he needed a break. He had not had any idea this 
    was going to be this difficult. He had to look at everything, and by this he meant everything. 
    Not only the unnoticing feet that were constantly about to trot on him, or the suddenly moving
    chairs that had already nearly crushed him, or the wandering little dog that was a bit too 
    interested in him, but also everything else. If he was a lollybuster, and could change himself 
    into anything he wanted, then it meant all the other lollybusters could do the same, and 
    therefore they could be anything! He could not change into anything very big, but he had no 
    idea if this was the case with other lollybusters as well. Therefore he couldn't tell if the half 
    empty yellow can behind the door was a lollybuster until he went and asked, or if another 
    lollybuster was looking at him from the pocket of a jacket that was hanging from a mountain 
    high black chair. 

    Well, they weren't. But he could not know until he checked, and this was dangerous. He 
    had to stop in the middle of the floor and shout at the brown envelope seen halfway over the 
    tabletop, or at the lamp leaning over the table, and he had to go deep into the corner to be able
    to speak to the green, dusty plant standing there, and anyone could see him while he was 
    doing this. 

    Well, nearly anyone. At least those who leaned over, and looked really, really hard. It 
    was dangerous anyway, and Rolfin didn't like doing it. He liked to be seen only when he 
    wanted to, and talking to a deaf envelope was not one of those times.

    By the lunch time Rolfin had developed a system. He would check only things that wereno more than twice his height, whatever that was at the moment, and only things that had 

    something lollybusteric about them. Like not being a dog, for example. Or a table leg. Or a 
    spoon. He had checked all of these at some point, for no use, and was getting rather unpatient.
    Then he decided no lollybuster would ever make himself anything as dull as a spoon, at least 
    not without any colouful dots or jellylike appearance, and therefore he could leave the rest of 
    the spoons unchecked. As well as piles of paper, dust bins, lonely socks with holes in them 
    and paper clips, at least if they were not bent. 

    The system helped, and after Rolfin decided that he could leave anything plain brown or
    gray undetected as well, he actually got on quite quickly. By dinnertime he was nearly all the 
    way through the room, and could already see the vast carpet plains ahead of him. And then, 
    when he had almost reached the door and was, for the first time in his life, ready to leave the 
    room, he heard a sound. 

    It was a very lollybusteric sound indeed. It was like a very small lion with a nasty throat 
    infection would have tried to sing opera wearing tight rubberpants in front of his mouth, while
    banging his head on the closed tin door. With that impression lingering in his mind, Rolfin 
    knew there was another lollybuster near by. He turned around.
    He had some trouble in seeing where the other lollybuster was. He had no trouble in 
    hearing him, since the sound had grown a lot louder. Any minute now, he suspected, trying to 
    sit on his thirty ears, the windows would blow up and they would all be buried in sharp blades
    of glass. 

    But fortunately at the very last minute the sound stopped and a very eager voice asked 
    instead: ”What on earth are you?”

    Rolfin opened his eyes and looked at the green, shiny little ball-shaped creature, that 
    wore huge red earrings on the top of his head. He pulled himself straigher, and annouced, very
    satisfied: 

    ”I am Rolfin, an adult male lollybuster. Just like you, I suppose.”

    The other creature laughed. ”Oh, no! I'm Regina, a lollybuster indeed, but I'm not male! 
    I'm an adult female lollybuster, and you should have seen that in the first place!”

    Rolfin was flabbergasted. A female lollybuster? A female lollybuster? ”Are you sure?”
    Regina nodded calmly and changed her colour to shiny yellow, as if that proved 
    anything.

    Rolfin had to sit down and think hard. He had not known there were such things as 
    female lollybusters. Well, he hadn't been sure there were other lollybusters of any kind, 
    actually, but that was a point not worth pondering anymore. Clearly there were others, or at least this one other, and it claimed to be female. Rolfin thought about it for quite some time, 
    and he had to admit that probably it, or she, knew what it was. He, after all, knew he was an 
    adult male lollybuster, even though nobody had told him.

    ”And you're adult?”

    Regina had stood patiently watching and waiting for Rolfin to think. Now she smiled 
    radiantly and changed her colour to light blue. ”Absolutely yes.”

    ”And how do you know?”

    The female adult lollybuster stared at him and no longer seemed very patient. ”What do 
    you mean how do I know? I know because I know, that's how! How do you know you're an 
    adult male lollybuster? What if you're female, too?”

    Rolfin felt horrified. No, he could not be female. That would mean he would be a she, 
    and somehow he just knew that was not the case. And here he was, on his journey to find out 
    other lollybusters to tell him how to be a proper adult male lollybuster, and what could he do 
    if the first lollybuster he ran into was female? It was not his fault!

    It took quite a while for all these thoughts to cruise through his head and out from the 
    other side, but once he was done he looked hard on Regina and made a decision. The big wide
    world had thrown a female lollybuster on his way, so perhaps a female lollybuster was the one
    to help him.

    ”Well, how do we start?”

    It was Regina's turn to look flabbergasted. ”Start what?”

    Rolfin made a vague gesture towards to the world in general. ”You know – being lollybusters.
    In a proper way.”

    Regina stared at him. ”You haven't started being a lollybuster yet?”

    Rolfin felt annoyed. ”Of course I have, but, you know... The way you're supposed to be.
    The right way.”

    Regina's face brightened up. ”Oh, the right way. Well, that's easy. You just hang around,
    and try to see as much as possible, and try to be as many colours as possible. Yesterday I 
    made it to 17 in one hour, but then I got tired. 11 is a nice number and easy to remember, so I 
    decided to be that today.”

    ”What, to be eleven?” To Rolfin's eyes Regina didn't look very elevenish, even though 
    he had to admit he had never seen anything really elevenish to compare her to.

    ”No, to be eleven colours an hour. I have already been purple, yellow, lime green, 
    orange with white dots, white with red dots ” -

    Rolfin felt the conversation was going somewhere he didn't want it to go to. ”So you mean that's all there is? To be eleven colours an hour and try to see as much as possible? How
    do you do that?”

    Regina sat down and started organizing her earrings into a new position. ”Well, you 
    obviously think of the colour you would like to be -”

    ”No”, interrupted Rolfin again, ”the part where you see as much as possible. Does that 
    mean travelling?”

    The adult female lollybuster in front of him seemed a little unsure. ”I – well, I would 
    think – well I haven't - ” Then she drew herself up and frowned. ”What do you mean? Of 
    course it means travelling! I have travelled all the way up here!”

    ”From where?”

    Regina turned her head, which was now of a beutiful shade of light blue, and then 
    pointed her long finger triumphantly towards a corner near by. ”From there!”

    The corner she was pointing at was about 15 centimeters from the place they were 
    standing now. Even though Rolfin admitted he was no speeder, even he would have been able
    to get there and come back in some minutes. ”You mean you started there this morning?”

    ”No, you silly little male. I started there last Monday!”

    Rolfin tried hard to not look as amazed as he felt. However he did sound exactly as 
    amazed as he felt: ”You started there last Monday?”

    Regina shrugged and sniffed a little offended. ”Do you have a problem with that?”

    ”No, no, I just thought that when you said travelling you meant... That travelling 
    means... That you would have... you could have...” Rolfin stopped and tried again. ”So what 
    have you seen? While you have been... travelling?”

    Regina brightened up and jumped to stand up. She clapped her hands and seemed 
    suddenly very brightly lit. ”Oh, lots and lots! You can't even begin to guess what!”

    Regina was right. Rolfin didn't even have a chance to start guessing. Regina was so 
    eager to share all her wonderful experiences that she wasn't able to wait, but told Rolfin 
    everything right away. And this meant, once again, everything. Rolfin had never undestood 
    that travelling across the room – or half a foot, to be precise – could be so exciting. Actually, 
    he still didn't. To him Reginas's experiences were not particularly interesting, but he listened 
    politely the seemingly endless list of all the things she had seen: paperclips, dust balls shaped 
    like lions, tigers and three-eyed dogs, dustbins, shoes, carpet, bits of cheese, bread and 
    cinnemon rolls, a pen, three pencil stubs in different shades of yellow...

    But enough was enough. Rolfin had seen pretty much all the same things (and even some more, but this he found wise not to mention to Regina) and could not be bothered to 
    spend an entire day listening them listed one after another. As politely as he could, he 
    interrupted Regina and told her that his intention was to move on, away into the next room, 
    and that he wished Regina all the best but thought it was time for him to say goodbye. Regina 
    wasn't as offended as he had feared, but let him go with only slightly irritated notions about 
    how unwise it would be to be in a hurry all the time and how adult male lollybusters 
    obviously didn't know good time when they bumbed into it. But alltogether the parting went 
    quite well and they agreed they both had learned a lot and become better lollybusters as a 
    result and that the next time they would see each other they would really sit down and have a 
    decent chat. And then Rolfin felt he had said every polite word he knew and in order to 
    prevent the unpolite ones emerging, he went.

    It was pretty dusty back there, behind the door, but when the dust had settled (and it did this 
    rather soon, since a lollybuster the size of half a pea doesn't really move that much dust 
    around) he looked around, and gasped. Could he have found the next lollybuster right away?
    Leaning against the wall was a large bright yellow monkey. It wore a red shirt, green tie 
    and it had a really long tail curling above its head and around the little red cap on top of its 
    head. It was smiling broadly, and looking somewhere behind Rolfin. 
    Rolfin swallowed and looked around. Nobody was near, and the monkey seemed 
    friendly.

    ”Hello”, Rolfin said shyly.

    ”I wouldn't bother with that if I were you”, a voice said. 

    Rolfin was confused. Was someone telling the monkey not to bother with him?

    Then a little figure stepped out behind the monkey. It was bright yellow as well, but 
    looked more like a pig on two feet, only that the feet looked like cat's paws, if somebody 
    would have painted them green. It wore a blue collar and a large oval-shaped hat with a bow 
    on it, and it grinned happily to Rolfin. 

    ”Nice to meet you. You must be a lollybuster, too, I can tell. And boy, have I been 
    waiting for you!”

    ”You can see I'm a lollybuster?” Rolfin couldn't believe his luck. Could this be an adult 
    male lollybuster as well?

    ”Why, of course! Nobody would look like that if they were not lollybusters. I'm John, 
    John the 5th Cheesehunter.”

    ”John the 5th? There are more of you then?”

    John smiled broadly and waved his hand around. His pig face seemed to radiate with 
    pride. 

    ”Why, yes! There were John the 1st, John the 2nd, John the 3rd and then, surprisingly but 
    unquestionably Roger the 4th. And then me.”

    ”And are they here with you?” Rolfin tried to look around as politely as possible. He 
    just couldn't wait to see five whole lollybusters at one go. 

    But John the 5th shook his head and looked sad. ”No, I'm afraid they are not. They have 
    gone already.”

    ”Gone where?”John the 5th sighed, and his voice trembled a bit as he answered: ”Gone to the great 
    cheeselands, to hunt the greatest of them all, the Big Cheese!”

    Rolfin couldn't say that explanation made him any wiser. ”So... are you going to follow 
    them?”

    For some reason the other lollybuster seemed offended. ”Of course I am, one day, but 
    not for ages yet! Or do you think I look old?”

    Rolfin couldn't make the connection between these bits of conversation, but perhaps you
    could go for the big cheeselands only when you grew old? But to calm his fellow lollybuster 
    he began shaking his head very pointedly and told John the 5th that he had never seen a 
    lollybuster looking younger, and in such a good shape. This seemed to satisfy John and he 
    asked with whom he had the honour of talking and would he be so kind as to share his meal 
    with him. Rolfin told his name and also that he would be very pleased to share his meal with 
    John, as he was very hungry indeed and would appreciate company. After these formalities 
    were over, they sat down on the feet of the yellow monkey (that was, now that Rolfin had a 
    really good look, only a monkey-shaped bottle, and the yellow colour came from the liquid 
    inside it - ”Shampoo”, told John, even though this said nothing to Rolfin) and had a bite of 
    Rolfin's sandwiches. John the 5th didn't seem to mind eating Rolfin's sandwiches, of which he 
    was very proud: now he could tell the whole world – if it was to listen – that his sandwiches 
    had been accepted by a real number-in-his-name-type! Rolfin was not quite sure why it was 
    important, but surely it meant more to have someone with a number in his name to accept his 
    sandwiches than someone without one.

    ”So”, said Rolfin after some serious chewing had passed, ”can I ask you something?”

    ”Sure.”

    ”You're an adult male lollybuster, right?”

    ”That's me, you can bet on it.”

    ”So... I mean, would you mind telling me what it is all about? Lollybustering? How do 
    you know how to be a proper lollybuster? How do you know when you have... done things 
    right?”

    The older lollybuster smiled benevolently. ”Oh, that's easy. You just do as your 
    ancestors have done before you.”

    ”You mean...” Rolfin tried to memorize the list, ”you do as John the 1st, John the 2nd
    , John the 3rd, Ronald - ”

    ”Roger”, corrected the 5th John - 

    ” - and Roger the 4th have done before?”John nodded.

    ”But how do you know?”

    ”Know what?”

    ”Know what they have done?”

    ”That's what we need the heritage for”, said John the 5th proudly.

    ”Heritage?”

    ”Yes, heritage. It tells us what they have done!”

    And that was all there was to it. Rolfin had expected the heritage to be some huge secret book 
    into which all the deeds and words of the ancestors (John the 1st, John the 2nd, John the 3rd and 
    Roger the 4th) would have been written, but John the 5th explained to him that was not the 
    case. The heritage was just something you knew, something you had been told about and how 
    you were supposed to keep going.

    For a second Rolfin had been exhilarated and thought he had found what he had been 
    looking for, but John the 5th had – very kindly, Rolfin had to admit – shot this thought down. 
    ”You can't live on anybody else's heritage”, he explained. ”You have to have your 
    own.”

    ”But I don't have one! Can I then just go and make one up?”

    But apparently that was not acceptable either. 
    Rolfin sighed. This was going to be much, much more difficult than he had ever 
    thought.

    ”Can I at least follow you for some time and see how your heritage works?”
    That was acceptable, and Rolfin put on some more eyes and ears to see and hear 
    everything worth noticing, in case he would this way understand something essential about 
    being a proper adult male lollybuster.

    It turned out he didn't. As far as John the 5th was concerned, lollybustering was all about 
    loitering around, eating (Rolfin's) sandwiches, and boasting how heroic and noble his 
    ancestors had been. It had been fascinating in the beginning, but Rolfin soon noticed all the 
    earlier Johns – as well as the one single Roger – had been actually doing very little. Their 
    heroism seemed to consist of telling the world in general that if something huge and 
    dangerous and awful should have the guts to face them, they would very soon regret it. How 
    and why was not explained by the heritage.

    Besides this, the vastly appreciated heritage told John the 5th very little, except very 
    strict and peculiar rules how to drink your tea, when to change colour and who should bow 
    first in case one of the Cheesehunters would meet any wandering count, earl, mount or girl 
    during his daily businesses. To Rolfin all this seemed rather useless, since John the 5th didn't 
    drink tea, didn't really change his colour (only its tone) and as regards to the passing counts 
    etc., Rolfin very much doubted John the 5th had ever seen or would ever see one. Living 
    behind an office door didn't add up one's possibilities to socialize, or whatever was the term 
    used when meeting a mount passing by.

    So Rolfin left again. He gave his thanks to his host, wished him well and told him if he ever 
    was going to find a heritage of his own, he would recognize it only thanks to John the 5th. 

    And then he met Jack.

    Jack was standing in the middle of the floor and watched Rolfin approach. This time 
    there were no questions whether he was a lollybuster or not, since he was carrying a large sign
    above his head which said: ”Beware of Jack the Lollybuster”. His gigantic, flopping ears tried
    to fall over the sign every now and then, but every time Jack managed to catch them before 
    they hit the sign. Finally, when Rolfin was only a few inches away, he turned his ears into two
    corkscrews pointing right and left.

    Rolfin walked a few more steps and stopped. He felt a bit shy. He had no sign showing 
    who and what he was, but perhaps he should have? Putting one up now would seem imitating,
    and he didn't want to start a conversation that way.

    ”Hello, there”, said Jack, and somehow succeeded to give the impression that he was 
    looking down on him, even though he was hardly the same hight as Rolfin.

    ”Hello”, answered Rolfin.

    ”And you are?”

    ”I am Rolfin, an adult male lollybuster.”

    ”That I already noticed”, said Jack dryly and looked Rolfin from head to toes. ”So?”

    Rolfin felt confused. ”So... what?”

    Jack sighed. ”You young people are always so impolite. You are supposed to say 
    pardon when you're unsure what you just heard.”

    Rolfin was even more confused. ”But I did hear you.”

    ”And then why did you say so what?”

    ”You asked me so, so I thought - ”

    ”Oh you silly little creature”, said Jack unpatiently, took a step forward and grabbed 
    Rolfin's arm. ”You don't have to pretend to me, dear. We are both lollybusters, for heaven's 
    sake.” And he started walking very determinedly towards a table standing behind them.
    Rolfin could do nothing but follow. He didn't feel any less confused, but then again, 
    perhaps finding out how to be a proper male lollybuster was confusing. He had so much to 
    learn, and Jack obviously knew something about lollybustering that he didn't.

    Under the table was quite a cosy little place, a little sofa and a couple of arm chairs, a table laden with sandwiches and little bits and slices of fruit, even a fireplace – ”It's only for 
    show”, said Jack, though he never told Rolfin what kind of a show. They sat down, Jack 
    offered some food to Rolfin and then watched very keenly as Rolfin ate it. His gaze was so 
    keen that halfway Rolfin started wondering whether he ate in a totally wrong way, or if the 
    food was poisoned. 

    ”Aren't you having anything?” he asked finally.

    ”No, I just ate”, said Jack. Then he sighed, tapped his white-and-green-striped belly and 
    said that all of them could not eat all they wanted, they had their figure to think of. 
    Rolfin's hand touched the figure (a diamond lying down) between his eyes. Jack's figure
    was a rectangular. It didn't seem to be in the way of eating, but perhaps it was hurt? Rolfin 
    had once torn his diamond-figure on a sharp edge of a paper, and for days it had been difficult
    to frown properly. Perhaps this was the case with Jack, too? He was too polite to ask, but 
    realized there was something else as well that was interesting in Jack's speech. He stopped 
    eating and looked around. 

    ”All of you? So there's more of you here?”

    ”Of coarse there are”, answered Jack, ”lots and lots.”

    ”All lollybusters?” asked Rolfin eagerly.

    ”All lollybusters what”, asked Jack, keeping his eyes on the large apple slice Rolfin had 
    been chewing.

    ”They are all lollybusters, I mean”, explained Rolfin.

    ”What”, asked Jack now, looking suddenly annoyed.

    ”Aren't you supposed to say pardon when you're unsure what you just heard”, Rolfin 
    could not help saying.

    Jack jumped to his feet and clapped his hands. ”Now that you have eaten”, he said, 
    ignoring the fact that Rolfin was still holding a large part of the apple slice in his hands, ”let's 
    get to the point.”

    Rolfin put the apple slice down and swallowed. Well, he had left for this journey to 
    learn how to be a proper male lollybuster and not to eat apple slices. ”OK, fine with me.”
    ”So”, said Jack, his large eyes sparkling, ”what do you want to know?”

    Rolfin felt a broad smile breaking on his face. Finally, here was someone who 
    understood what he had come for!

    But before he had time to ask anything, Jack had hopped beside him and once again 
    grapped his arm. ”Oh, why not, I'll show you it all!”Years later, when Rolfin was already a respected adventuror, he used to look back to that 
    afternoon as one of the crucial moments in his life. ”Without Jack the Lollybuster, I wouldn't 
    have become what I am today”, he often said, looking thoughtfully to the distance. And it was
    only his closest friends who knew what exactly it was that he meant.

    ”What do you mean you have seen enough? You haven't seen anything yet!”

    Jack was upset, Rolfin could tell, but once again he had had enough. He was the first to 
    admit he had had no idea what lollybustering was all about, but surely he had expected 
    something else. Gathering a wardrobe you had to walk into, and more specifically, a wardrobe
    you had to walk into with a map, and even more specifically, a wardrobe you could get lost in 
    and wander on for weeks was not what he had expected. After all, the one thing he knew 
    about being a lollybuster was that you changed your shape a lot, which meant clothing was 
    something of a nuisance because you really couldn't be sure how many legholes you needed 
    in your trousers the next minute. 

    ”What is this anyway? A horror wardrobe?”

    Jack frowned. ”What do you mean?”

    Rolfin looked at some of the clothes hanging in front of them, and pulled one out. It was
    a shiny green-and-blue-striped coat with a tiny red collar, it had three sleeves, each of 
    different length, and a tail sewn under the left armpit, and tied to its back was a black men's 
    shoe. Rolfin felt amused.

    ”Look at this! When are you supposed to wear this? The one who designed this surely 
    had no idea what a lollybuster looked like, or what a lollybuster is for that matter.”
    Jack grew taller, and glared at Rolfin.

    ”I designed that!”

    ”You?”

    ”Yes, me! And the rest of them, too! And this”, he said, grabbing the costume Rolfin 
    was still holding, ”is the ideal costume to be worn when you have a slight cold with a mild 
    headache!”

    It was only now Rolfin noticed the signs. They were all over, hanging neatly above each
    row. To the left of him there was a sign telling there were ”costumes ideal for an afternoon 
    tea”, a couple of rows ahead were ”costumes ideal for an afternoon nap” and a couple of rows 
    from that ”costumes ideal for an afternoon gap”. On his right side were ”costumes ideal for 
    sinister conversations”, ”for spinster conversations” and ”for spinning red loom”. No doubt 
    there were ideal costumes for blue loom or bachelor conversations as well, if he only went on looking.

    ”I have spent ages to make all of these. Isn't that why you came to see me? To ask about
    my famous collections?”

    Rolfin looked around. Row after row was packed with shiny clothes, velvety clothes, 
    clothes made of linen or leather or orangepeels, or at least something looking very much like 
    it. Taking a closer look he could see they all did have various amounts of sleeves and legs and
    sizes, which showed they were meant for lollybusters all right, but still. Was Jack serious? 
    Even if you knew what kind of a conversation you were going to have, you still had to go 
    through dozens and dozens of different outfits in order to find one you could actually use. 
    And even that could be useless because by the time you had found one you might want to talk 
    about or be something totally different.

    ”That's ridiculous”, said Jack when Rolfin had pointed that out. ”One can always 
    change one's appearance to fit the clothing he wants.”

    Rolfin stared at John. To change oneself to fit an already existing piece of clothing? 
    That was ridiculous if something. Nobody would do that! A lollybuster changed according to 
    his moods and the things he – or she – planned to do. One might want to have a conversation 
    about spinsters, even though Rolfin had his doubts about that, but to want to have a 
    conversation about spinsters and to be of a certain shape was unheard of. What if the 
    conversation turned into lobsters, or spinning green loom? Were they supposed to rush into 
    the wardrobe and look for appropriate clothes and to change accordingly before continuing? 
    What if the other lollybuster didn't want to talk about spinning but wanted to throw dices 
    instead? Rolfin had a vision about lollybusters running back and forth in the depths of the 
    wardrobe and asking each other desperately ”Are we going to talk about weather? Sunny or 
    rainy weather? Heavy or light rain? Snow or water?”, and he didn't like it. 

    ”But wouldn't it be better the other way round”, asked Rolfin finally. ”You know, make 
    them as you go? To fit the shape you are?”

    Jack looked as if Rolfin had told him to take his head off and bake it in the oven. ”Make
    dresses to fit the shape you are? Nonsense. Pure madness. No. Absolutely not.”

    ”Why not?”

    ”It just... it... it just doesn't work that way”, explained Jack. 

    ”So you just change your shape to... fit the costumes”, asked Rolfin.

    ”Of course”, answered Jack. ”For instance, this is a costume I used watching a 
    spectacular sunset over the window sill, and this one I had on when sitting nonchalantly on 
    top of a white envelope, and this one - ””Doesn't it hurt?” Rolfin's voice was nothing but a whisper. He might not know how to 
    be a proper male lollybuster, but he did know that trying to be something you really didn't
    want to be was very, well, trying, and usually ended up bursting into a shape you really 
    wanted to be in, in the most inappropriate moment, with a loud bang, and sometimes, 
    unfortunately, with a very unpleasant smell. It just didn't work. If the freedom of change was 
    taken away from a lollybuster, you might just as well start calling yourself something else.
    Jack had the decency to look a bit embarrassed. ”Well, no. Not really. You get used to 
    it, anyhow.”

    Rolfin nodded, and Jack's voice faded. For a moment they stood there quiet, looking at 
    their feet.

    ”Well...” said Rolfin then, not quite sure how to continue.

    ”Yes, yes”, nodded Jack, waved his hands around, ”things to do, places to go, you 
    know...”

    Rolfin nodded again, then coughed. ”Well, thank you. This has been very educating, 
    and very... informing. Yes. Informing. Now I know where to come if I ever need an ideal 
    costume for making a – ” he glanced at a sign next to him – ”three-legged wooden kitchen 
    chair. Yes.”

    ”Yes. You're always welcome to come back, of course”, said Jack, ”whenever you feel 
    like it. Whenever.”

    ”Great”, said Rolfin, and then they stood there for some quiet time more. Finally Rolfin 
    felt it was time to go, shook Jack's hand and set off. As he had nearly left the space under the 
    table, he turned, and saw Jack was still standing where he had left him, holding the ideal 
    costume for a slight cold with a mild headache against his chest.

    Rolfin walked towards the doorway, and thought hard. So, he had met Regina, to whom the 
    most essential lollybustering was to be as many colours as possible, Jack the 5th, who made 
    through his days to fulfill his heritage, and Jack, who lived to fit an ideal costume for every 
    occasion. To Rolfin, none of these made any sense. He couldn't see the core of lollybustering 
    in any of them. On the other hand, they very well could. Each one thought they knew how to 
    be a proper, well-reputated lollybuster.

    He stood in the middle of the vast carpet plain and stared ahead. Maybe that was to 
    whole point? All the others thought they knew what lollybustering was all about, and they all 
    thought it was something different. And no noubt, if he continued his search, he would find 
    others who would have their own views. 

    So, what was stopping him from making his own rules? To decide that for Rolfin the 
    most important part of being a lollybuster was to always wear something yellow? Or to sing 
    every day? Or to sleep hands facing south?

    Rolfin sighed. He had been so ready to believe what the others had said, and then none 
    of it had been of any use. Maybe for him the most important part of being a lollybuster was to
    never believe what the others said?

    But no, that wasn't good either. Though he didn't believe most of the things Regina, 
    John the 5th and Jack had told him, meeting them hadn't been pure waste of time either. 
    Regina had taught him that there were female lollybusters, for one thing (and that seemed to 
    make the future somehow more interesting, now he came to think of it), and John the 5th had 
    told him quite a few interesting facts about kings and queens, and Jack – without Jack he 
    woudn't have known there were lollybusters who thought clothing was important. And 
    besides, if he decided he wouldn't believe anything anyone said it would only make him very 
    sad, not to mention a very troublesome conversation partner.

    But perhaps his number one rule could be, that everybody could decide for themselves 
    what the most important thing was?

    That felt right. Rolfin felt himself grow taller as he let the thought fill his mind. Yes. 
    And that meant also, that he didn't have to know it right away. Perhaps it could even change 
    as he changed? That when he was loud and green and spiky, the most important thing was to 
    be scary, and when he was tiny and sparkling it was to be light, unless he thought it was to be 
    fragile. And so on and so on, throughout his life, he could always decide for himself.”Are you going to stand there all day?” asked a voice behind him.

    Rolfin turned around. A female lollybuster (and this time he had no doubt about that) 
    was standing in front of him, wearing a white frilly fur and very, very long eyelashes. Without
    any conscious intention, Rolfin blushed.

    ”No, miss, I hope not. No. Going any minute now.”

    ”So where are you going then, when you're going?”

    Rolfin blinked. Where was he going?

    ”Nowhere special”, he finally said. ”And on my way there, everywhere.”

    ”It's a long way, there”, said the girl, smiling.

    ”Maybe, maybe not”, answered Rolfin.

    ”You want some company?”

    Rolfin felt a broad smile breaking out. 

    ”Sure, why not.”

    With company, finding out what the most important thing for every moment was might 
    be even more interesting. With any luck, it might even be fascinating.

    And then they left, nowhere special, and on their way there, everywhere.
