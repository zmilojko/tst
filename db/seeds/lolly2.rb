    Meeting Annie-May was probably the best thing that had ever happened to Rolfin.

    Breaking up with her, only two and a half weeks later, was probably the worst.

    And the stupidest.
    
    They were both lollybusters, which helped getting along, at least so that they knew what not
    to expect. They knew not to expect the other to stay the same day in day out, which was more than
    can be said of many people, but then again, changing was more or less what being a lollybuster was
    all about. Lollybusters could change into anything they wanted, supposing they did not want to be
    anything above one eighth of an inch. They could be any shape, color, texture, have any amount of
    heads, hands, legs and tails, or be without them if they wanted, make loud or silent or tapping
    sounds, leap, hop, crawl or slide. There were only two things lollybusters could not change, and
    those they could disguise to fit the color or texture of their present state. The things that remained
    the same were the two eyes each lollybuster grew up with (nobody knows exactly whether
    lollybusters are born or hatched or if they just drop from some mysterious parallel universe, perhaps
    living in the attic) and a figure located between them.

    His figure was a diamond lying down, Annie-May's was a diamond standing up. If that was
    not destiny, then what was?

    They had met at the best possible moment. Rolfin had just come to the conclusion that
    despite all the advice other lollybusters had given him, he was the best person to decide for himself.
    Therefore he had not wasted time trying to figure out whether it was a wise move for an adult male
    lollybuster to start traveling with an adult female lollybuster right after he had met her. He had just
    accepted her offer to keep him company - no questions asked.

    And then they had traveled for two and a half marvelous weeks, enjoying each others'
    company, conversations and everything, and then...

    Then Rolfin had realized something was wrong.

    It had started gradually. Looking back, it would probably had been better if it had all
    happened at once. Then he would have been so terrified he would have told Annie-May
    immediately, instead of the gradual worry building up and him trying to keep her from noticing.

    It was a beautiful sunny morning, and they woke under a very comfortable fallen leaf. It had
    dropped from a large green plant standing in the corner of the room, and they knew from experience
    some huge giant would come later and take all the fallen leaves away. But they still had plenty of
    time.

    Or so they thought. All of a sudden, without any warning, they felt the floor tremble (like it
    always did when those gigantic creatures were walking somewhere near) and heard heavy thumps
    approaching. Any moment now the giant might lean closer and pick up the leaf, and by doing that,
    would reveal them.

    Instinctively they started to change. It was nothing they really had to think about, at least not
    in a very thoroughfare way. All they had to do was let their mind grab the first impression that came
    across, which usually in circumstances like these was either ”something that cannot be seen” or
    ”something that hides well”.

    Annie-May changed, quickly and perfectly, into a ball that was exactly the color of the floor,
    and started rolling towards the corner. There were always holes and cracks wide enough for a
    lollybuster to fit in.

    But Rolfin just stared. He was vaguely aware of Annie-May screaming something, but could
    not take his eyes of the gigantic feet getting closer and closer. He was still hiding under the leaf
    when the feet stopped and a huge hand began its slow motion towards it. He tried to change into a
    dust ball. His left side did turn into ball-like shape and his right side turned gray, but since the figure
    he tried to change from was furry and bright purple, the overall impression was hardly unnoticeable.
    He tried his best, but only ended up looking like a very tangled greyish wool thread. At the last
    minute Annie-May threw herself on top of Rolfin and managed to roll him to the corner just in time.

    ”What happened”, Annie-May asked after the giant had picked up the leaf and gone.

    Rolfin was terrified to the marrow and just shrugged. ”I don't know.”

    ”But you just... didn't change!”

    ”I know.”

    ”But you just... you couldn't?”

    Rolfin shrugged again, his heart still pounding. ”I don't know.”

    ”You just couldn't change.”

    ”I... wouldn't call it that”, said Rolfin.

    ”What would you call it then”, asked Annie-May.
    Rolfin gave it some thought. ”I don't know”, he then admitted. ”I just wouldn't say I
    couldn't.”

    And that was all he had to say about it. He would not discuss it any further, and did not admit even
    to himself how worried he was. If something like that happened once, it could surely happen again?
    And it did. Not right away, and not always. He still managed to change himself properly
    every now and then, sometimes even brilliantly. He had not lost it altogether.
    But every time he did not make it, he felt his trust in his ability diminishing.
    And even though he did his best not to show Annie-May how worried he was, she noticed
    anyway.

    ”Do you think you should do something about it?” she asked one evening.

    She had pretended not to notice how Rolfin, very nonchalantly, tried to change himself. Not
    to anything particular but at least to something, which he then could have claimed to be exactly
    what he had had in mind. It was obvious he was not doing it well. He was able to turn himself
    slightly more yellow, and to get rid of the two extra pairs of legs he had thought were a good idea a
    day earlier, but that was more or less it.

    ”Like what?”

    Annie-May looked uncertain. ”Well, you're probably not the first male this has ever
    happened to - ”

    Rolfin straightened up. ”What makes you think it's only males who.. you know, face this?”

    ”I don't, I just thought - ”

    ”Well you'd better stop”, sniffed Rolfin, and walked away.

    Next morning Annie-May brought the subject up again.

    ”Don't you think there could be someone who could help you?”

    ”Help me with what”, asked Rolfin, who knew exactly what she was talking about.

    ”You know, to get your...” Annie-May hesitated. ”To get your act together?”

    ”To get my act together.” Rolfin tasted the words in his mouth. ”To be honest, no.”

    ”Why not?”

    ”If I may remind you,” Rolfin started with a voice he knew perfectly well to be annoying,
    ”when we met, I had just met a few other lollybusters. And, if I may add, I had just figured out that
    the only person who is really able to tell me how to live my life properly, is me. Do you remember
    me telling you so?”

    ”Yes, I do”, Annie-May said a little offended, ”but don't you think this is something
    different? I'm not suggesting you go and ask others how to live, just to - ”

    ”No, you're just suggesting I go and ask others how to change. Something I have been
    perfectly capable of doing all my life, without any instructions!”

    ”Yes, you have. But just aren't anymore.”

    To be honest, Rolfin was dying to go and ask someone what was happening, and how he
    could be fixed, and then get over it. But surely Annie-May understood he could not just nod and
    agree? He was an adult male lollybuster for heaven's sake, and they did not run for help the minute
    something went wrong! At least that was how he had thought about it. All Annie-May had to do was
    to keep on persuading him so he would not lose his face but could say instead that it was Annie-
    May's worrying that pushed him to ask for help - he just could not take it anymore and thus would
    do anything to stop it, and that way he could get the help he needed as well as come out as a decent
    non-whining male lollybuster.

    But apparently Annie-May did not use the same users guide from which Rolfin took his
    instructions. She waited for Rolfin to say something and when he did not, she sighed and said very
    quietly that perhaps Rolfin did not want her to participate so deeply in his life after all, perhaps he
    had only been looking for some fun and perhaps she should leave.
    That time, Rolfin managed to get the right kind of words out of his mouth, and they had
    settled for the rest of the day.

    Then came the next morning. Rolfin tried to turn himself into a thin pencil-like figure, but failed
    miserably, and Annie-May had no choice than to suggest once more that he would ask for help, and
    Rolfin said he saw no reason for that, and they were right in the middle of a fight already before
    breakfast.

    ”Seriously, Rolfin, if this thing doesn't change - ”

    Rolfin laughed gloomily. ”I would have no problem if it only changed.”

    ”You know what I mean.”

    ”I'm sure this is nothing serious. I'm sure if we only give it some time - ”

    ”We have given it time. Almost a week now. What if this... problem means there is
    something seriously wrong and you end up dead in another week unless you do something!”

    There were no doctors for lollybusters. As a matter of fact, the concept of a doctor did not
    exist in the lollybusteric world. How could it exist? Lollybusters were unique creatures. None of
    them was the same, and therefore how could you tell if something was wrong? Usually, if a
    lollybuster felt something was not right, he or she just changed into something that was. A sore
    throat had a difficult time trying to keep up when the throat it had clung itself to disappeared and
    turned into another, very healthy one. The same applied to broken limbs, or any parts: if a leg or an
    arm or a nose broke, a lollybuster could always throw it away and start anew.

    But there were some, who definitely were not doctors, but who lollybusters could... consult,
    yes, that might be the word, when things... just went wrong. And the fact that these... consultants
    existed was common knowledge among lollybusters, even though they did not know how they
    knew. After all, they usually did not like to live very close to other lollybusters, and they very
    seldom actually saw others of their kind. Lollybusters did not have any actual school system either.

    Of course there were some older lollybusters who could say to a younger one that it was a wide
    world out there (this might pass as geography), that creating wings was not quite obligatory when
    planning to dive (a biology lesson) or that things had been better in the old days (an important piece
    of history knowledge). So how did they know?

    Rolfin did not know. He had a vague memory of John the 5 th, the second lollybuster he had
    seen on his first trip, a keen follower of family heritage, mumbling about something that had not
    worked as planned, and that a certain lady had had something to do with it. At the time Rolfin had
    thought that John the 5th had tried to keep the poor lady warm, she had been shivering after all, but
    perhaps he had not gotten the picture quite right? However, the whole subject had seemed a little
    shady, he had gotten the impression John the 5th had... consulted someone and all he could really
    remember was John the 5th looking into his eyes and saying:

    ”Rolfin, whatever you do, don't let them cut anything off.”

    He had no intention to. He could very well do his own cutting, thank you very much, and if
    Annie-May was trying to get him to meet someone whose first idea was to cut pieces out of him
    then, well, she should think again.

    ”Do you really have to talk about it all the time?” Rolfin said.

    Annie-May looked frenzied. ”If I don't, you'll do nothing about it! Or perhaps you'd rather
    be left alone?”

    Rolfin shrugged. At the moment, if being with Annie-May meant continuing this
    conversation, then yes, he would rather be left alone. If she meant a long-term arrangement, without
    her, then no. She could have put her words more accurately.

    Once again Annie-May was not using the same users guide, and narrowed her eyes looking
    very mean.

    ”You think you'd be better off without me, don't you?”

    This was something Rolfin did not have to think about. He shook his head. ”No.”

    ”Then what do you want me to do? Stand here and watch how you fail to change and get
    more and more miserable? I want to help you!”

    Rolfin shifted uncomfortably. He would have loved to change his shape in order to have at
    least something else to do than having this talk, but, alas, he could not.

    ”Have you noticed anything?” Annie-May asked after a while. ”You do manage to change
    every now and then. Do you have any idea why you are not always able to?”

    Rolfin shook his head again. He had thought about it, though. First he had thought the
    problem was in changing color at the same time as shape, but that did not cover all the failures.
    Then he had thought the trouble was due to changing too frequently, and he had tried
    limiting the number of changes he made each day. That had not helped either.

    The next conclusion had been to avoid open places, because many of the unsuccessful
    incidents had taken place in such surroundings. That way he had seen a lot more of narrow corners
    and low hollows than he would have cared for, but it had had no effect on his ability to change.
    ”Not a thing? You haven't noticed anything, anything at all?” Annie-May looked desperate.
    Rolfin began to shake his head again, but then realized there was one thing common to all
    the cases.

    ”It never happened when I was alone”,

    Apparently that was not an answer Annie-May had hoped for.
    Rolfin tried to explain that he only said what was true and did not mean it as an accusation,
    that it was quite possible it had nothing to do with his problem, that actually the more he thought
    about it the less he saw any way it could have any connection with it. He just had realized he had
    managed to change himself into anything he wanted as long as he had been alone, but it was just as
    true to say he had not had these problems when he was with John the 5th or when he was under a red
    sock he had found one time at the beginning of his travels, but did that mean he wanted to spend the
    rest of his life with John the 5th? Or under that red sock? No, it did not.

    But it turned out Annie-May was in no condition to listen to his explanations. She had
    stopped listening right after he had used the word ”alone” for the first time, and she was in full
    swing now. She should have realized, she said, that Rolfin was an adult only by his size, that he was
    nowhere near of being capable to fully commit to a relationship, that he had been looking for an
    excuse for some time already, and that she was not dumb. He might think whatever he liked, but she
    was not born yesterday and that since this was where it all had come to, Rolfin was free to go
    where-ever and whenever he liked, she would not stop him. Actually, she would do more than that:
    she would go and leave him right at this moment since she had no intention of stopping him of
    being whatever it was he wanted to be, far from it, she would give him his freedom there and then
    and it would be all his, here you are, goodbye and sorry for bothering.

    She said some other things as well, but these Rolfin was not able to hear properly because
    she was halfway through the room by then, whereas Rolfin had not been able to move his limbs at
    all.

    And it did not make any sense. She seemed to realize an awful lot in just a few seconds,
    things she had not ever even mentioned before. He knew that he was an adult, by his size and also
    otherwise, he had not been looking for an excuse for anything except sometimes for doing some
    really heavy burping, he knew she was not dumb and of course she was not born yesterday. If she
    was, they would have met before she existed and even though he had heard of ghosts, the spirits of
    already dead lollybusters coming back to do some hovering they apparently had not been able to do
    while still alive, he had never heard of anyone coming to haunt before living themselves. What
    would be the point? Would they be saying ”Just testing! I can't really decide whether to be a
    lollybuster or a snail, so I decided to give it a try first”?

    But even if he threw all that aside as some random words that just kept propelling from her
    mouth, she still seemed very determined to leave.

    ”Annie-May”, he whispered, but that did not make much difference.

    ”Annie-May!” he shouted.

    ”Annie-May”, he shouted louder, but the adult female lollybuster did not turn back. He was
    alone, as alone as only a rejected lollybuster could be.

    And the worst part was that being alone did nothing to Rolfin's capability to change. He tried it, of
    course, as soon as he realized Annie-May was not going to come back, and immediately felt guilty
    for doing so. Wouldn't it have been somehow more chivalric if he had refrained from trying it? If he
    had been so heart-broken that he wouldn't even have remembered to try?
    Perhaps, but then he would have missed the chance of a perfect reconciliation. If he only had
    found that the only thing necessary for him to be able to change was that Annie-May was not
    looking! It might even have seemed a bit cute, you know, him being so shy he did not want her to
    see him changing. He could have even managed to claim it was all because he wanted to surprise
    her. It would have made life a bit more complicated, but not unbearably so, and he was pretty sure
    they would have made their way through it. They might even have made it a little private joke,
    something like ”We don't like to show slow motion, we like it abrupt”or ”You can't say I never
    surprise you”. He was the first to admit they might not be the best private jokes in the world, but
    they were the first ones that had come to mind. They could have made them better.
    That was, if there had been any need for them.

    All his fine plans were made more or less empty by the observation that he was just as
    incapable of turning into something else as he had been an hour earlier. Even turning his back on
    Annie-May and pretending he was alone in the whole room had not made him any better at it. If
    anything, it had probably made him even worse, since by turning his back on Annie-May he might
    not see if she was leaving, and his concentration shattered.
    It had been a long and painful night. They had both sat on their respective corners, Annie-
    May pretending she did not see Rolfin, and Rolfin staring at her back and wondering what he had
    done wrong.

    Luckily, in the morning, he knew.
    What was the thing Annie-May had been asking him to do? To meet someone. To ask
    someone about this all. And if that was what it would take to get her back, then that was exactly
    what he would do.

    ”Annie-May” he shouted.

    Her back, gleaming black at the moment, showed no signs of her listening.

    ”I just wanted you to know... I'm... I'm going to see someone. You know, about this...
    problem.”

    The back seemed just a tiny bit more responsive.

    ”And then I'm coming back. Here, I mean. And it would be really nice if... if you could be so
    very kind and... you know, be here. When I get back.”
    Still no answer. Rolfin sighed. ”At least that's what I hope for”, he said, and turned to leave.
    ”Good luck”, he heard a silent voice whisper. But when he turned to look, her back was as
    immovable as before.

    Finding a... consultant was not going to be easy. All that time he had been on the road, ever since
    the early days when he had looked for someone to tell him how to be a proper lollybuster, he had
    seen less than a dozen lollybusters. What was more important, none of them was a... consultant.
    At least no-one seemed like one.

    Was being a consultant something you could see right away? Would they all be wearing, for
    example, blue ears or red tails or white coats?

    No, that would be ridiculous. Then someone could just copy that feature and pretend to be a
    consultant, and all the honest suffering lollybusters with real problems would be cheated and left
    without help. Being someone who could help had nothing to do with outer appearances.

    But how, then, could he recognize one?

    ”Hello there? Can I help you?” An eager voice tried to catch his attention.

    It would help if they used a sign of some kind, thought Rolfin. Perhaps something that
    would tell others it was OK to ask.

    ”That's what I do. I help lollybusters, that's me. All day long, looking for answers to all
    kinds of problems.”

    But of course they would do nothing of that kind. It would be so typical, thought Rolfin
    quite annoyed now, that there they were, lollybusters who could help others, smirking and hiding
    themselves and not telling anyone.

    Perhaps they even laughed at those poor lollybusters whom they saw looking for help.

    ”So if there's anything I can do for you, just say so. I'm here, ready to help.”

    Those bastards! Rolfin felt himself getting pretty angry, and was ready to punch any hiding
    consultant he would see.

    If only he could find one, that was.

    ”Anything. Really, just name it. Here to help.”

    Was somebody talking to him? He lifted his eyes and saw a small, roundish lollybuster with
    blue ears, a red tail and a white coat smiling friendly at him. He seemed to be standing behind some
    counter on wheels, and above him was a big sign saying ”If you need any help, just ask”.
    Rolfin's face brightened. He strode to the desk.

    ”You help people?”

    The other lollybuster nodded.

    ”Then could you help me to find where all the consultants are hiding?”

    Afterward it felt humiliating. But he had been so deep in his thoughts, how was he to hear
    everything? If he started paying attention to every fellow calling him he would... Well, he might
    lose some very interesting and thorough thoughts, that was for sure.
    Spinner was very considerate. That was the name of the helping consultant that had stood
    there in front of him, telling him he was hiding nowhere and actually was quite looking forward to
    help him since, after all, it was what he did. And he smiled friendly and brought a chair Rolfin could
    sit on and asked what he could do to help him.

    It took some time for Rolfin to answer that question. It was harder than he had thought,
    admitting his changing skills were almost gone. He nearly got up and left, but the memory of
    Annie-May's black, turned back kept him sitting down.

    It turned out Rolfin was not the only adult male lollybuster who suffered from the same
    symptoms.

    ”Oh, no. It's quite common”, said Spinner, ”happens to most of the males some time or the
    other. Stress is usually the main cause. Get rid of stress, and you will be back on the track in no
    time.”

    Stress?

    ”I don't think I've been that stressed lately. Are there any other reasons?”
    Spinner looked empathic. ”Often one doesn't recognize the stress. It can build quite
    gradually. Any changes in your life lately?”

    Obviously not enough, thought Rolfin, but admitted he had left his childhood home quite
    recently. (By childhood home he meant the place he first remembered being in - terms home and
    childhood are a bit difficult when talking about lollybusters, since nobody really knows how
    lollybusters originate. It is known that they have very little use for words like mother or father, that
    they hardly ever talk about siblings and that their understanding of childhood is that it is a period
    which they cannot really remember. Therefore the term childhood can be used for describing a bad
    hangover or a case of amnesia, even though to a non-lollybusteric audience it does not make much
    sense to hear things like ”We had a marvelous party but I got carried away and got a pretty bad
    childhood”. Further studies on lollybusters' early development are being made.)
    Rolfin also admitted he had gotten himself some company recently.

    ”A lady?” asked Spinner, his eyebrows rising.

    Rolfin admitted this was the case.

    ”The first lady companion of yours?”

    He had met Regina, on his first day traveling, but like he told Spinner, they had met only
    briefly and therefore he would not call her a real companion.

    ”Well, then”, said Spinner leaning back and smiling broadly, ”I would say that's the reason.
    You try to impress the girl, right?”

    Rolfin nodded, a bit embarrassed. How did he know?

    ”How often?”

    These questions were getting very intimate.

    ”Well... Not so often, perhaps three or four times a day.”

    Spinner laughed a little, wrote something on a little piece of paper, took a little bottle and
    and handed it with the paper to Rolfin.

    ”You youngsters should remember not to exaggerate. No wonder you don't feel like it if you
    try to do it with full thrust four times a day. The problem usually fades away when you learn to
    relax and not to worry about your performance. In the meantime, I'd say you give yourself a little
    rest and don't even try it. Then if after a couple of days things haven't improved, here are some pills
    you could take. One pill half an hour before you want to make your move. And, no overdoses. They
    might change you more than you'd really like to.”

    And with a wink Spinner put away the papers he had been scribbling on, lifted the handle of
    his cart and began to walk away. ”You can find me from the yellow pages if you need me”, he
    shouted over his shoulder, and then with a wave of his hand he was gone.

    The young lollybuster felt confused. He had a feeling there was something in that
    conversation he had not quite understood. What was wrong with trying to make an impression?

    Annie-May had often applauded after a really successful turn, and when he had changed into
    exactly the pattern of the curtain hanging behind him, she had even come over and kissed him. That
    had been kind of nice. After a very successful change he had felt he could be anything, and had had
    no trouble for quite some time.

    The problem was, the fewer the successful changes were, the less he felt he could manage
    them. There were times he thought the only thing he was capable of turning into was a tiny little
    dust ball, gray and shapeless.

    And then these pills Spinner had given him. What was he supposed to do with them? How
    could he say beforehand that he wanted to make his move half an hour later? Did that mean he
    could make only two moves an hour? Boy, he would better be in a comfortable place then. Or fast
    asleep.

    Rolfin sighed. Finding a consultant had been easy, but finding some real help seemed to be
    trickier.

    Longingly he gazed towards the room where he could still see Annie-May sitting. No going
    back, yet.

    He placed the little bottle into his pocket (available behind his left ear) and turned to face the
    rest of the room.

    Time to get going. No consultants calling for him this time, so it was his task to find one.

    For the next two days Rolfin wandered through several rooms. The conditions were against him:
    Giant feet were all over, he met curious dogs running free, the vacuum cleaner was on and off and
    one hideous afternoon all the furniture of the room he was in was removed and replaced. It was
    difficult trying to hide behind dust bins and chair legs when they were suddenly lifted and taken
    away, and even more so when you could not build a camouflage in a split of a second.

    However, he survived, a little bruised but in one piece, and as the second night fell, he could
    finally sit down by a lush greenery and breath with a sigh of relief. The room was silent and empty,
    and for all he knew, he could very well be only meters away from the next consultant.

    It turned out he was wrong.

    He was only inches away from the next consultant.

    ”Ah, hello there”, said a friendly voice somewhere from the midst of the green leaves.
    Rolfin stood up and tried to see who was talking. ”Hello?”

    A short, slightly worried-looking female lollybuster walked towards him. ”Mandy
    Shawlbearer, that's me. Very nice to meet you, young man.”

    Rolfin told his name, and they shook hands. Then Rolfin asked whether there was any
    chance she might know any... consulting lollybuster near by, since he had a problem and could use
    some consulting.

    ”Ah, what a coincidence – I happen to be one. And may I ask what the problem is?”

    After ensuring there was no-one else around Rolfin told her. The lady seemed thoughtful.

    ”Sit down, my boy, sit down. Lucky for you, I have studied the latest therapeutic practices -
    now, tell me, how was your childhood?”

    As mentioned before, childhood is a term lollybusters use quite loosely. Therefore it was no
    wonder Rolfin felt even more confused than normally. His childhood? Which of them?

    As far as he could remember (and that was a tricky notion if any), he had had three
    childhoods. All he could remember from the first one was that there had been some yellowish cloth
    hanging near by, and a deep sense of satisfaction because of that. The second had something to do
    with ladders lying on his face. And the third one had happened quite recently, when they had found
    an open bottle of some brown liquid lying sideways on the floor and he had climbed in to find out
    whether it was poisonous or not. It had been, obviously, and it was only Annie-May's quick action
    that had saved him from drowning into the bottle.

    But whether or not any of these incidents had anything to do with his problems of changing
    his shape, he was not sure.

    ”How was your relationship with your mother?”

    Mother? Was he supposed to have one? ”It was OK”, he hazarded.

    ”Did she tell you how much she loved you? Or did she tell you you were a naughty little
    boy?”

    Who were they talking about? Who was this mysterious Mother-character? He had no
    recollection of ever running into her, but then he did not know the names of all the things he had
    met. Since Mother was a she, could she be the female they had seen with Annie-May, leaning
    against a car on their third day together? She had grinned very happily, but they had not talked to
    her.

    But if she was Mother, Rolfin knew what to answer.

    ”No, she never said a word to me.”

    She certainly did not give any love confessions. And a good thing that she did not, since
    Annie-May might have hit her. It had already been bad enough that Rolfin had tumbled on his own
    feet while looking at her leaning.

    But it had not been his fault. He had never seen anyone enjoy leaning so much. Her grin had
    been practically from one ear to the other, and she had seemed to purr too.

    Besides, he had never seen anyone in bikinis before, either. Annie-May had explained to him
    later that actually the outfit was meant for swimming, or sun-bathing, but Rolfin was sure she had
    got that wrong. The sunlight was way too dry to bathe in, the female had not been wet, and unless
    she was going to swim in that brown liquid they found later, there was no place to dip your toe in
    anywhere nearby.

    And that male lollybuster had been rather impolite. The way he had jumped out of nowhere
    and yelled at them, something about ruining the shoot. That had been insane as well, since nobody
    was shooting anything and the only living creature apart from them was the female lollybuster, now
    grinning wider than ever, and surely he was not going to shoot her?

    For some reason, now that he thought about it, he actually might have liked if she had called
    him a naughty little boy.

    ”And your father?”

    The question floated into Rolfin's ears and stopped him from imagining any further.

    ”My father?”

    ”Did he ever talk to you? Did he say he loved you?”

    If the female leaning on that car had been Mother, perhaps the male shouting at them had
    been Father? He only wished Mandy would not put your in front of their names. It made it all seem
    far more intimate than he felt their relationship had been.

    What the question had been again? Oh yes.

    ”Well, he did talk to me, but he mainly yelled.”

    ”No words of encouragement?”

    Rolfin gave this some thought.

    ”He did say he had never seen such a gift of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.”
    Mandy shook her head and scribbled something furiously. Rolfin waited patiently.

    Finally the lady lifted her head, looked Rolfin in the eye and said gently: ”Rolfin, I know
    what has caused your problems.”

    ”Really?”

    ”Yes”, said Mandy Shawlbearer, a lollybuster consultant, ”I sure do. It's all due to your lousy
    childhood.”

    Once again Rolfin took a moment to think about his childhoods. It had never occurred to
    him there might be something lousy about them, but hey, he was not a consultant. Perhaps others'
    had more colorful childhoods, or they took place in fancier settings.

    ”You never got any real love or affection, not to mention encouragement from you parents.
    No wonder you feel unable to change. You feel that the only way for you to feel safe is to be in a
    shape you know already, a shape that doesn't judge or abandon you.”

    He did?

    Mandy leaned to tap Rolfin's arm and smiled. ”But now you're safe. We can work through
    this together. Trust me, one day you'll be able to change like never before!”

    That was nice to hear. He would have preferred this day, though, but perhaps fixing this
    problem did not happen so quickly.

    ”Great! So, how does it happen?”

    Mandy wrote something on a piece of paper and gave it to Rolfin. ”Same time same place,
    see you here next week. We'll start digging further into your childhood and get all your inner grief
    out.”

    Inner what? Rolfin stared at the paper and started to feel more anxious. ”But...”

    The older female lollybuster seemed to be leaving already. ”Talk to you again next week!
    And that will be quarter of a banana and a sandwich, thank you!”

    Rolfin moved his stare to the lady. ”What will be?”

    ”My fee, of course! Quarter of a banana and a sandwich for ten minutes of consultation,
    standard price around here.”

    Eventually they solved it out. Mandy realized that Rolfin really was new to all this and had not
    realized she did not do the counseling just in order to help, but needed something to eat as well.
    Rolfin offered to pay her in parts, but Mandy said she should have asked if he could afford it before
    beginning the counseling, so it was mainly her own fault and she refused to take any of his
    sandwiches either.

    ”But perhaps another time? We did get such a good start”, Mandy suggested hopefully, and
    while Rolfin did not by any means think they had gotten anywhere, he smiled and said that yes,
    perhaps, he would keep her in mind.

    And then it was time to move on, for both of them. Mandy had a lollybuster to consult
    further behind the greenery, and Rolfin just felt he was better off anywhere further away.
    Was there anyone in the big wide world that could help him? He had real trouble seeing any
    connection between the behavior of the mysterious couple they had met and his inability to change.
    Even though the man had been perhaps a little too rude, Rolfin still saw no reason why he should
    have encouraged him, a perfect stranger. And it seemed a bit far fetching to assume that the female,
    what was her name again, ah, Mother, should have fallen in love with him the second they met.
    Not that he would have minded, though.

    It could have been quite nice, actually.

    He would have handled it very smoothly. He would have been polite and pleased but, in the
    circumstances, he would have firmly reminded her that it was not considered very polite to dump
    the lady you were with at the moment, just because some other female had not been able to resist
    his charm. It was understandable, he would have said, but she had to be reasonable and just keep on
    living her life without him. His love and affection was devoted to Annie-May, for good.
    And Mother would have shed a tear, but agreed, and Annie-May would have been proud and
    they would have walked hand in hand towards the sunset, or at least towards the flashing light in the
    corridor ahead.

    Except that Annie-May would not have just stood there and listened. She was not that kind
    of a lady.

    She would have probably told Mother to bugger off and quit dreaming.

    Or she would have laughed long and hard and told the other female she was just wasting her
    energy since Rolfin had some quite annoying habits she was happy to shed some light on.
    Perhaps it was just best that none of it had ever happened.

    But what if it had, just a little bit? Who knew what Mother had thought, behind her black
    glasses?

    Deep in his thoughts, with a vague smile on his face, Rolfin walked towards a gray
    bookcase. It looked like a good place to spend your night under, and it was close to the door. That
    would make it easy for him to slip into the next room in the morning, even if there were those
    gigantic creatures hanging around.

    It was late, and it was already getting dark. The dim night-lamp could be seen high above
    the giant door, and the window was nothing but a slightly lighter square hanging in the middle of a
    vast, shadowy wall. Darkness was usually no problem for lollybusters, since if they chose to, they
    could always become something that saw perfectly well in the darkness. However, Rolfin, with his
    current inability, and his present form that served him well in bright daylight, knew very well he
    was barely able to tell a wall from a roof in the twilight.

    ”Must be careful not to bump into things”, he mumbled, and was then happily lost into his
    daydreams again, completely unaware of his surroundings.

    And there he was, walking through a room full of boxes, waste bags, things fallen from the
    waste bags, in nearly complete darkness, humming to himself and never bumping into anything. It
    was, as far as everyday miracles go, a pretty nice one.

    Too bad he did not notice it himself.

    ”Would you mind your feet?”

    Rolfin focused his eyes towards a figure standing by his feet. He had just been dreaming
    about a huge upright banana he had tried to quarter with a tiny little dessert fork, and was actually
    quite pleased to be interrupted.

    The figure was roundish and brown and had some resemblance to a teddy bear. It was a
    lollybuster, though, since its ears were pointy and it had two pairs of hands. It was holding a large
    broom, and was patiently waiting for Rolfin to lift his feet.

    ”Oh, sorry”, Rolfin said and moved a little.

    The other lollybuster swept the floor, and then looked at Rolfin.

    ”On your way somewhere?”

    ”Yes”, admitted Rolfin. ”Though I don't know exactly where, yet.”

    The other lollybuster nodded. ”That's the way it often is, on the road.”
    He swept a little more. Rolfin yawned, and the little bottle Spinner had given him fell from
    his pocket, rolling beside the sweeper's feet.

    He lifted it. ”You have seen a consultant, haven't you? Spinner, I'd guess.”

    Rolfin stared. ”How did you know?”

    The sweeping lollybuster shrugged. ”I've seen those bottles before. Spinner hands them
    around, that's his answer to everything. Doesn't mind about what happens afterward, no. It's all up
    to me, cleaning up the traces.”

    ”What do you mean? What happens afterward?”

    The other lollybuster handed the bottle to Rolfin. ”Oh, nothing much. Disappointment.
    Desperation. Things coming to an end way too soon.”

    Rolfin felt that the bottle was somehow heavier than before. He had had no intention of ever
    using it, but now the bottle seemed solely repelling. Could mere carrying it bring misfortune?
    The other lollybuster seemed to know what Rolfin was thinking.

    ”It can't harm you unless you open it, boy.” Then he touched the brim of his left ear and
    smiled. ”I'm Dustman. And you are?”

    Rolfin took his eyes off the bottle. ”Rolfin.”

    The males shook hands, all six of them, then Dustman started to sweep again. ”So, whom
    did you see next?”

    ”How did you know I saw anyone after Spinner?”

    Dustman moved his broom around a pebble. ”You get to know things when you have a
    profession like mine. You can tell a lot by what a person leaves behind. It's surprising really, what
    people manage not to take along with them.”

    ”Really?”

    ”Yes. Everything from teeth to love letters, from furniture to full-size cows. Once I found an
    elephant, totally lost in these corners.”

    ”Really? A whole elephant?” Rolfin tried to imagine Dustman guiding a huge elephant out
    of the room, but failed. The largest creature he could imagine was a calf, and even with that he had
    trouble. He shook his head. ”But I never left anything behind!”

    ”That's what you say. How about that pretty little thing that keeps weeping a few rooms
    from here?”

    Annie-May? How on earth did he know about her, too? Rolfin really ought to ask him that.

    ”I didn't want to”, he burst instead. ”I would've wanted... you see, I only wanted... but you
    know, I can't... But I intend to go back.”

    ”When?” Dustman looked at Rolfin very keenly, and suddenly Rolfin got suspicious.

    ”What is all this to you? How come you know all these things, whom I saw and what they
    did?”

    Dustman shrugged, and leaned on his broom. ”I told you. One sees a lot when walking with
    a broom. Sometimes people come back, when they realize they left something worth keeping, after
    all. And that tells a lot of them as well. Who returns, and for what reasons. Of course I might be
    totally wrong about those folks who don't return, but who's to tell?”

    ”So you're not some... weird fairy god who looks after me and tells me wise things to do?”

    The eyebrows on Dustman's face wrinkled. ”Me, a fairy god? Never heard such rubbish in
    my life! Does this look like a magic wand to you?” He shook his broom in front of Rolfin's face and
    Rolfin had to admit that no, it indeed did not, but Dustman did not listen. ”I could use one, though,
    yes I could. Would make all the floors to clean themselves up, that's what I would do. And would
    fly all the garbage people leave behind, would make it all fly straight back to them, never mind how
    far they think they'd ditched them. Yes, that's what I would do. Everything back to them, I'd let them
    sort it out by themselves.”

    Then he seemed to remember Rolfin and pointed a brown, fluffy finger towards him. ”And
    that's exactly what I should do with you, young man. Send you straight back where you started
    from. No use leaving a smart and pretty girl crying all alone. What were you thinking, leaving her
    just like that?”

    ”But you see, I left to find the cure for -”

    Dustman was still in no mood for listening. ”Yes, yes, you left for a cure, don't they all? And
    then you go and meet a consultant and it doesn't do you any good, then you go and meet another,
    the same thing, and then you meet an innocent sweeping Dustman and think he's a fairy god! Living
    in a fantasy world, you are! Just because I'm the third person you meet you think I'd be some
    mystical chap with a wand and all the knowledge in the world, giving you all the answers and
    letting you off the hook! What has happened to thinking? Finding some answers by yourself? This
    is not a fairytale, young man!”

    Rolfin felt embarrassed and confused. He had never thought, except for an infuriatingly
    short moment, that Dustman would give him all the answers, but that did not really matter. He had
    left in order to find some answers from other people, he had thought they would know what he
    should do. But he had left only because trying to figure it out by himself had led nowhere. So what
    was he supposed to do?

    After cooling off a bit Dustman stopped waving his broom furiously around and apologized
    for being mean. Of course he knew Rolfin would not have left Annie-May if he really did not have
    to, and naturally he had the brains to think for himself. It was just that he had seen so many pure
    idiots lately he could not help himself; for starters, one had asked Dustman if he could walk behind
    him and pick up all the feet, tails and wings he kept dropping, as if he was some kind of a personal
    servant; another had thought Dustman was there to whip all his worries away by singing merry
    songs all day long. But Rolfin, he could tell, was different.

    And then he patted Rolfin on the shoulder and said that if he only thought less of the
    problem and more of what he really wanted to be, everything would be fine.

    ”But that's exactly the problem!” cried Rolfin. ”I can't think of what I want to be since I'm
    too afraid I'll fail again!”

    ”And what happens if you fail?”

    Rolfin had a spicy answer right on the tip of his tongue, but paused. What would happen?
    Sometimes, when changing was essential, failing to do so could risk his life, but then again,
    being a lollybuster was taking a risk. If he had wanted to be safe, he should have been born as a
    sofa, or a rock.

    But other than that? He had sometimes had a nasty blow when he did not manage to become
    soft and flexible while falling, or he had not been able to go everywhere he wanted as his head or
    butt, or in one very interesting case, his ear, had got stuck on the way. But what about it? None of
    that had led into anything dangerous, and while he could have survived without those bumps, how
    did they really differ from the bumps he had gotten while forgetting to change? Or while changing
    into something unsuitable, like when he had thought it a good idea to become a square to go
    through a mouse whole?

    Perhaps living, of any kind, meant getting bumps and bruises.

    ”You're right”, said Rolfin. ”I've been making it a far too big a deal. It's time to go back.
    Annie-May's been waiting long enough.”

    ”And what do you plan to say to her, if I may ask?”

    Rolfin took a deep breath. Yes, that was important. Since he did not come back as a cured
    lollybuster, he would have to have a good explanation.

    ”I'll say... I'll say that changing one's appearance is not what lollybustering is all about. That
    being a lollybuster, or any living thing, means that some day you'll stop being it, and therefore...
    Therefore what matters is how you spend your time in between. And if I have trouble changing
    myself, it only means I have trouble changing my looks, it doesn't mean I can't change internally,
    and... I think that's the important side.”

    Dustman nodded. ”Sounds pretty good to me. Is that all?”

    No. That was not all. ”And inside, I know where I want to spend my life. With her.”

    A greyish handkerchief appeared from somewhere, and Dustman wiped his forehead. ”Oh
    dear, it's hot in here.” Then he threw a glance at Rolfin. ”You didn't think your speech was that
    touching?”

    Rolfin mumbled something, and tried to look as if he had never thought about it. Even
    though he did think he had found a very good wording for his thoughts and feelings. It was not
    every day he had a chance to say something like this, which, on the other hand, was quite nice
    because if he did, that would mean he'd be in trouble every day and he doubted the speech might
    lose some of its poignancy when repeated on a daily basis.

    ”Well, what are you still waiting for? Off you go, young man, go tell your girl what you just
    told me.”

    As Rolfin left, eager to get rid of the distance between him and the female of his life,
    Dustman waved his broom goodbye, and tiny little golden specks shimmered around him in the
    sunlight that was just bursting through the curtains. ”Oh, you just couldn't keep out of sight
    anymore”, Dustman murmured. ”All right, have it your way.” The broom seemed to jump from joy,
    then it lifted itself, aimed towards Rolfin's distancing figure, and shot a cloud of sparkling dust after
    him. By the time it reached Rolfin, the only thing still visible was a faint glimmer on his fur.
    ”Good job, boy, good job”, said Dustman, patting the broom. ”OK, come now, time to move
    on. We've got some other fairy god parenting to do.”

    It was nearly dawn when Rolfin finally got back. Annie-May was still sitting her back towards him,
    but this time the back was light blue and looked far more approachable. Rolfin coughed.
    Annie-May darted around. ”Rolfin!”
    For a moment they just stood still, looking keenly at each other. Rolfin swallowed. Annie-
    May was far more beautiful than he had remembered. Well, she had been pulsing with fury and
    therefore had been spiky and pretty dark shaded the last time he had seen her, but all that was gone
    now.

    ”You're back.”

    ”Yes, I am.”

    Rolfin handed her the flowers he had picked up on his way back. Somehow it had seemed
    like the right thing to do.

    Annie-May took the flowers, and looked at Rolfin.

    ”So did you find what... what you left for?”

    Rolfin felt nervous. This was it. He had to get it right from the beginning, or Annie-May
    might never listen to him anymore.

    ”No.”

    ”No?” Annie-May's eyebrows rose.

    ”No. But that doesn't really matter.”

    ”It doesn't?”

    ”No, since I realized... As long as I'm with you, it really doesn't matter. The only thing that
    does is that we're together. I might not be able to become rectangular and green every time I
    wanted, but - ”

    Annie-May started to laugh. ”Oh, Rolfin!”

    Rolfin was confused. He had not even finished his speech yet, but she was already reacting
    strongly. Well, to be honest, he had not expected laughter, but surely that was better than snorting?
    ”You almost scared me!”

    ”I did?”

    ”But look at you now. The minute you say so, you're perfectly rectangular, perfectly green.”
    Rolfin took a look. He was indeed. ”But I never intended to - ”
    Annie-May stepped closer and held out her hand. For a moment Rolfin thought she was
    going to shake hands with him, but she only touched his arm lightly. It was covered with soft, moss-
    like fur, and in the last rays of the sun it glimmered a little.

    ”I've missed you, you fool.”

    ”I've missed you, too, Annie-May, but you see I never - ”

    ”Oh shut up”, said Annie-May. ”You really think I want to be with you because you can
    change your figure into something particular? Any lollybuster can do that, and if you'd be the only
    one who could not, well, that would only make you more special. The only thing I was worried
    about was you getting so anxious about it. I don't know what you did or whom you saw but you
    seem a lot more relaxed now, so obviously you got the help you needed. Do you think you can
    continue being relaxed about things, whether they change or not? Do you want to be relaxed about
    things?”

    Rolfin thought about it. That was asking a lot. There were many things in life that he could
    imagine getting very upset about, even in the near future. And then he was pretty sure there were
    many others he could not even imagine. But was there any point pondering about them now? After
    all, he had ,for example, had this strange dream for ages, where he was walking through a crowd, all
    standing and looking at him and smiling, and finally stopping in front of a figure that was holding a
    huge book, asking him whether he wanted something or not, he never really got what the figure was
    asking him about except that it was very important to get it right, and there was someone on his left
    side, all dressed in white and holding some flowers, whom he turned to face and who was waiting
    as well, and even though everybody was smiling he was terrified and could not get a word out of his
    mouth – but had that ever happened in real life? No. And surely, if anything like that happened in
    real life, he would know what the right answer was? How difficult could it be to know whether you
    wanted something or not?

    Then he thought about the things the consultants had said. The things he should do to get rid
    of the problem. Compared to those, the original problem seemed suddenly quite small. Imagine he
    had believed them! He would have either ended up living by the clock, deciding beforehand every
    single time when he wanted to change. Or he would have ended being dependent on the tiny blue
    pills and Spinner giving him enough of them. Or he would have dragged tons of bananas only to
    hear Mandy's pity on what were, quite frankly, pretty normal childhoods for a lollybuster.
    But then again, who was he to say their advice was not good for someone else? It was a
    wide world out there, and very possibly there were some who needed the little blue pills and a
    calendar in order to be able to change as they wanted to, and some who were miserable because
    Mother had not loved them. What if Father, the impatient yelling male, was so impatient exactly
    because of that?

    But Rolfin would leave it up to them to decide. He was just happy to be back home, since
    home, he realized, was where he wanted to be, and he wanted to be with Annie-May.
    And talking about Annie-May, she had changed herself into something white and frilly. The
    flowers Rolfin had given her seemed extra colorful now, held against all that whiteness. And she
    seemed to be waiting for something. What could that be?

    Oh yes. An answer. Whether he wanted something or not.

    Rolfin smiled, and nodded solemnly. Answering this was going to be easy.

    ”I do.”
